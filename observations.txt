Some observations on the Py City Schools data frames:

Looking at the schools ranked by %Passing Overall, the top eight performers were Charter schools and the bottom seven were District school.

About a third of students went to Charters while two thirds attend District

The amount of money spent per student is negatively correlated with performance.

The small and medium schools performed similarly and the large schools posted lower scores.

Note: There is a slice error on two of the later data frames.  The tables still print and the numbers are good.  Will and I couldn't work out the issue. Please ask him any questions about this issue you have.
